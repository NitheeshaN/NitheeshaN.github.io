## Workshops

<b>Spring 2024: Introduction to ROAR Collab: Interactive Jupyter Notebook and R Studio Sessions </b> [[Slides]](https://github.com/NitheeshaN/ROAR-Collab/) <br>
Center for Social Data Analytics, Penn State University <br>
In this workshop I introduce the Penn State High Performance Computing system and how to access it using ROAR Collab. I also provide a tutorial on how to use Jupyter Notebook and RStudio using an interactive session on ROAR Collab. This includes an overview of computer architecture and what an HPC actually is.

<b>Spring 2023: Introduction to ROAR High Performance Computing (HPC) System: Applications in Academic Research using R </b> [[Slides]](https://github.com/NitheeshaN/HPC-Introduction-to-Penn-State-ROAR-/) <br>
Center for Social Data Analytics, Penn State University <br>
This workshop includes a detailed introduction on how to use a High Performance Computing system (HPC). I introduce what an HPC is and how to submit batch jobs to the Penn State HPC. This includes instructions on how to code using BASH, formatting sh files and how to use external file transfer systems. Though some instructions are specific to the Penn State ROAR HPC, the majority of these procedures can be used for submitting jobs on any HPC system.
