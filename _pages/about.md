Welcome! I am a Political Science and Social Data Analytics PhD student at Pennsylvania State University. My primary research interests focus on subnational political elites, racial and gender based online discrimination and public officials social media networks. My most recent work measures hostility in Twitter discourse directed towards state legislators and racial and gender biases in this hostile discourse. Another one of my current projects investigates patterns in state legislators online endorsement networks. My other work with the [GAiN lab](https://brucedesmarais.com/lab.html) broadly centers on the intersection of public discourse, policy and applied computational analyses.

My methodological interests include machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, causal inference and time series analysis.
