Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate Political Science and Social Data Analytics at Pennsylvania State University. I am also an adjunct researcher at the RAND Corporation. My academic research interests lie at the intersection of race, gender, and digital politics. I focus on how subnational political elite's identity influences their online interactions and constituency engagement. My work addresses key questions regarding inequality, policy and the risks of emergent technologies in modern American politics. My other work with the [GAiN lab](https://brucedesmarais.com/lab.html) and the [Center for Social Data Analytics](https://soda.la.psu.edu/the-center/) broadly centers on topics within social media, public discourse and big data analytics. Our latest project, entitled the "Digitally Accountable Public Representation Database" is a new initative aimed towards advancing political communication research. Please check our [blog](https://sites.psu.edu/dapr/people/), for exciting new updates on our datapipeline and new research applications.

I apply a variety of computational social science methods in my academic research. My methodological interests include machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, causal inference and time series analysis. Part of my doctoral research advances our understanding of text-as-data methods by identifying necessary data preprocessing steps to scholars using topic models or LLMs for content analysis. 

I previously received a Bachelor of Arts with Honors in Economics with a minor in French at the University of Connecticut. My Economics Honors thesis investigates the evolution of human trafficking in the global South. I went on to receive a Master of Arts in Sociology at Stony Brook University. My research involvement while at SBU broadly investigates gender in a developmental context. These interests eventually evolved into my Sociology Master's thesis which examines the role of political satire in media. The through line throughout all my academic pursuits is my passion for evaluating the systemic effects of race and gender using rigorous methods.
