  <details close><summary>Abstract</summary>
  <i>A lot of attention has been paid to studying the online activity of the members of the United States Congress. This scrutiny has not been extended to state legislators. Very few studies exist which catalogue why state legislators connect and communicate with one another online in the ways they do. Inspired by this question and building on studies which have analyzed online communication of members of national legislatures, this paper aims to systematically analyze state legislator relationships in the online environment. We collect original data for 4000+ legislators and study patterns of connection and communication of state legislators on Twitter. The results from this study will help better understand what motivates tie formation in the online environment and if these patterns of connection conform to or can predict offline relationships. We test the impact of variables such as party affiliation, state, chamber, cohort, gender, and policy area focus on the organization of these online networks. We look at three main types of networks that can arise due to participation on Twitter - follower, retweets and mentions. We also aggregate the ties to infer dynamics between states.</i>

- **Attention to the COVID-19 Pandemic on Twitter: Partisan Differences among U.S. State Legislators** <br> _<ins>Legislative Studies Quarterly</ins>_ 2022 <br> Taegyoon Kim, Nitheesha Nakka, Ishita Gopal, Bruce Desmarais, Abigail Mancinelli, Jeffrey Harden, Hyein Ko, Frederick Boehmke <br> [Read the Paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/lsq.12367)
  <details close><summary>Abstract</summary>
  <i>Subnational governments in the United States have taken the lead on many aspects of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Variation in government activity across states offers the opportunity to analyze responses in comparable settings. We study a common and informative activity among state officials—state legislators’ attention to the pandemic on Twitter. We find that legislators’ attention to the pandemic strongly correlates with the number of cases in the legislator’s state, the national count of new deaths, and the number of pandemic-related public policies passed within the legislator’s state. Furthermore, we find that the degree of responsiveness to pandemic indicators differs significantly across political parties, with Republicans exhibiting weaker responses, on average. Lastly, we find significant differences in the content of tweets about the pandemic by Democratic and Republican legislators, with Democrats focused on health indicators and impacts, and Republicans focused on business impacts and opening the economy.</i>

- **The Racial and Gender Divide in Toxic Online Messaging Towards Politicians** <br> Nitheesha Nakka <br> [Read the Paper](https://osf.io/dvsne)
  <details close><summary>Abstract</summary>
  <i>Research on American politicians show that high profile minority politicians, and Republicans often face significantly higher rates of uncivil speech online. I expand on this research by examining the intersectional experience of gender and race at the state legislator level. Previous studies investigate behaviors towards federal representatives; however, local politicians have more day-to-day interactions with constituents which poses a greater risk to both online and offline violence. For this study, I use the Google Perspective API, a machine learning model that evaluates text to produce a continuous measure of toxicity; therefore, capturing the most authentically toxic tweets. Furthermore, this study encapsulates tweets mentioning legislators across all fifty states posted during the month of January 2021. In this way I capture the racial and gender biases in toxicity towards legislators during a notably violent exchange of political power in American history. I use a binomial logistic regression and ultimately do not find any evidence of a relationship between legislator identity and online toxicity directed towards them. There is a participatory effect in that legislators who tweet toxic tweets are more likely to receive toxic tweets in return. In sum, this study uses state-of-the-art methodology to detail how online toxicity towards subnational political elites is shaped.</i>

- **Racial and Gender Biases in State Legislators Twitter Endorsements: A Network Analysis** <br> Nitheesha Nakka <br> [Read the Paper](https://osf.io/sqmx2)
  <details close><summary>Abstract</summary>
  <i>Endorsements contribute to electoral success both in gaining a seat in office and legislative success once in office. And for candidates for local office, who ostensibly do not have an extensive political resume to precede them, an endorsement from an existing legislator with an established political career is an important campaign resource. But how do legislators decided to distribute this resource? And how does identity play a role in allocating endorsements? To explore these questions further I analyze the network of Twitter endorsements of state legislators and the racial and gender biases within these networks. My project contributes to the extant literature by revealing how endorsements flow between state elected officials and uncovering any biases in these flows. Using Network Analysis on a dataset of legislators’ endorsementrelated tweets from all fifty states I do no find evidence or co-gender endorsement patterns but do find significant evidence of co-racial endorsement patterns amongst legislators and state legislative candidates. This research allows us to understand how elites shape descriptive representation in state political office.</i>

- **Online Social Network Content Produced by Public Officials: Considerations in Topic Modeling** <br> Nakka, Nitheesha, Ömer F. Yalçin, Bruce Desmarais, Sarah Rajtmajer, Burt Monroe <br> 
  <details close><summary>Abstract</summary>
  <i>Statistical topic modeling is widely used in political science to study text. Researchers examine documents of varying lengths, from tweets to speeches. There is ongoing debate on how document length affects the interpretability of topic models. We investigate the effects of aggregating short documents into larger ones based on natural units that partition the corpus. In our study, we analyze one million tweets by U.S. state legislators from April 2016 to September 2020. We find that for documents aggregated at the account level, topics are more associated with individual states than when using individual tweets. This finding is replicated with Wikipedia pages aggregated by birth cities, showing how document definitions can impact topic modeling results.</i>
